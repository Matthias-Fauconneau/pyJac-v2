v2 tasks:
  ☐ Shuffle reactions in tech mech (and synch with chemkin version) to avoid masked
    problems where the map index == the actual index (e.g. with recent troe problem
    d60bd02)
  ☐ Figure out how to properly emit fast_powi / fast_powf automagically depending
    on data type
  ☐ Implement sparse Jacobian
  ☐ Add common BLAS / LAPACK implementations (e.g. matrix mul, inversion, etc.)
Improvements:
  ☐ Make libgen use codepy, since we depend on it already
  ☐ Remove sympy dependency
  ☐ Remove pyopencl dependency (only needed for testing)
misc tasks:
  ☐ Find a way to unify kernels, such that a single library / pywrapper exposes
    all available code

v2 tasks:
  ☐ Figure out how to properly emit fast_powi / fast_powf automagically depending
    on data type
  ☐ Setup TravisCI / tester
  ☐ Get the rest of the write race warnings
Improvements:
  ☐ Make libgen use codepy, since we depend on it already
  ☐ Add common BLAS / LAPACK implementations (e.g. matrix mul, inversion, etc.)
  ☐ Remove pyopencl dependency (only needed for testing)
  ☐ Fusion of similar kernels
  ☐ Preload of commonly reused data into __local mem for deep-vectorizations on GPUs
    ☐ Note: the utility of this is limited at the moment, as NVIDIA doesn't yet support atomics
      hence, this will become more pressing when CUDA support is enabled
  ☐ New targets: ISPC, CUDA
misc tasks:
  ☐ Find a way to unify kernels, such that a single library / pywrapper exposes
    all available code
  ☐ Look into Cog or Jinja2 to simplify code generation
    ☐ In that vein, we can possibly use these to improve codegen for loopy
      psuedocode (i.e. the input to loopy)
  ☐ Better tests of instruction creator

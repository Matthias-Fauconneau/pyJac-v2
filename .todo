Beta release task:
  ☐ Figure out how to properly emit fast_powi / fast_powf automagically depending
    on data type
  ☐ Get the rest of the write race warnings
  ☐ Get the new ambiguous dependencie warnings as well
Improvements:
  ☐ Make libgen use codepy, since we depend on it already
  ☐ Add common BLAS / LAPACK implementations (e.g. matrix mul, inversion, etc.)
  ☐ Make platform specification completely independent of pyopencl -- currently, it requires
    the opencl platform to be installed on the generating machine, but it should only require a
    platform file.
  ☐ Fusion of similar kernels
  ☐ Preload of commonly reused data into __local mem for deep-vectorizations on GPUs
    ☐ Note: the utility of this is limited at the moment, as NVIDIA doesn't yet support atomics
      hence, this will become more pressing when CUDA support is enabled
  ☐ New targets: ISPC, CUDA
Codegen:
  ☐ Find a way to unify kernels, such that a single library / pywrapper exposes
    all available code
  ☐ Look into Cog or Jinja2 to simplify code generation
    ☐ In that vein, we can possibly use these to improve codegen for loopy
      psuedocode (i.e. the input to loopy)
  ☐ Much more in-depth codegen tests
misc:
  ☐ fstrings for loopy-code generation
      ☐ Also, implement a compiler pre-define in loopy to make my life easier
  ☐ Better tests of instruction creator

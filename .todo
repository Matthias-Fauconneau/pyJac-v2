v2 tasks:
  ☐ Figure out how to properly emit fast_powi / fast_powf automagically depending
    on data type
Improvements:
  ☐ Make libgen use codepy, since we depend on it already
  ☐ Add common BLAS / LAPACK implementations (e.g. matrix mul, inversion, etc.)
  ☐ Remove pyopencl dependency (only needed for testing)
  ☐ Fusion of similar kernels
  ☐ Preload of commonly reused data into __local mem for deep-vectorizations on GPUs
misc tasks:
  ☐ Find a way to unify kernels, such that a single library / pywrapper exposes
    all available code
